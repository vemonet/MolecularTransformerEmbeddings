# MolecularTransformerEmbeddings
Code for the Transformer neural network trained to translate between molecular text representations and create molecular embeddings.

Network weights of a pretrained Transformer trained to translate between 83,000,000+ SMILES/IUPAC string pairs collected from PubChem are available for download, along with code to obtain embeddings for a list of SMILES strings.

The Encoder of the Transformer network can convert a SMILES string of length M into an MxN matrix, where N is the size of the embedding vectors used for each SMILES string character.

All testing was done on an Ubuntu 16.04 using Python 3.6.8 with NVIDIA GPUs. No GPU resources are required, but may be useful to speed up training/finetuning.

## Generate embeddings for SMILES strings

### From python

Generate embeddings for a list of SMILES string from python:

```python
from molecular_transformer import get_smiles_embeddings

smiles_list = [ "C(CC(C(=O)O)N)CN=C(N)N", "C1=C(NC=N1)CC(C(=O)O)N", "CCC(C)C(C(=O)O)N"]
embeddings_dict = get_smiles_embeddings(
    smiles_list,
    embedding_size=512,
    max_length=256,
    num_layers=6,
    checkpoint_path="./data/pretrained.ckpt",
)
print(embeddings_dict["C(CC(C(=O)O)N)CN=C(N)N"])
```

### From the CLI

1. To obtain embeddings for SMILES strings, simply create a text file with one string per line. Save this file in the data folder as ```YOUR_SMILES_STRINGS.txt```. An example file with 20 amino acids is included:
```
C(CC(C(=O)O)N)CN=C(N)N
C1=C(NC=N1)CC(C(=O)O)N
CCC(C)C(C(=O)O)N
CC(C)CC(C(=O)O)N
C(CCN)CC(C(=O)O)N
CSCCC(C(=O)O)N
C1=CC=C(C=C1)CC(C(=O)O)N
CC(C(C(=O)O)N)O
C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=CN2)CC(C(=O)O)N
CC(C)C(C(=O)O)N
CC(C(=O)O)N
C(C(C(=O)O)N)C(=O)N
C(C(C(=O)O)N)C(=O)O
C(CC(=O)O)C(C(=O)O)N
C(C(=O)O)N
C(C(C(=O)O)N)O
C1=CC(=CC=C1CC(C(=O)O)N)O
C(C(C(=O)O)N)S
C(CC(=O)N)C(C(=O)O)N
C1CC(NC1)C(=O)O
```
2. In the cloned repository run the following command to generate embeddings for your custom file:
```
python3 src/molecular_transformer/embed.py --data_path=data/YOUR_SMILES_STRINGS.txt
```
3. Embeddings are saved as a zip of numpy arrays, where each numpy array is an MxN matrix for a molecule. The arrays can be loaded in Python like this:
```
import numpy as np

arrays = np.load("embeddings/YOUR_SMILES_STRINGS.npz")
print(arrays['C1CC(NC1)C(=O)O'])
```
4. (Optional) use the ```view_embeddings.ipynb``` jupyter notebook to use embeddings interactively instead of saving them in the embeddings folder.

(Note: Pretrained weights must be downloaded using ```download.sh``` before embeddings may be obtained. Custom weights may be supplied using the ```--checkpoint_path``` flag when calling ```embed.py```)

## Training or Finetuning the Transformer Network

* Code for training the Transformer network on a SMILES-IUPAC string translation task is provided in ```train.py```. Pretrained weights are located in ```checkpoints/pretrained.ckpt```.

* Training data is stored in Tab-Separated Value files in the ```data``` folder. The files do not have any header row. Each line contains a SMILES string followed by a TAB character, an IUPAC name, and a `\n` newline character. Example data is provided, and custom training data can be used by creating a file ```data/YOUR_TRAINING_DATA.tsv``` with this structure:
```
CC1(CCC2C1CN(C2C(=O)NC(CC3CCC3)C(=O)C(=O)NCC=C)C(=O)C(C4CCCCC4)NC(=O)NC(CN5C(=O)CC(CC5=O)(C)C)C(C)(C)C)C 	(3S,3aS,6aS)-N-[3-(allylamino)-1-(cyclobutylmethyl)-2,3-dioxo-propyl]-2-[(2S)-2-cyclohexyl-2-[[(1S)-1-[(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-1-piperidyl)methyl]-2,2-dimethyl-propyl]carbamoylamino]acetyl]-6,6-dimethyl-1,3,3a,4,5,6a-hexahydrocyclopenta[c]pyrrole-3-carboxamide
C1=CN(C(=O)NC1=O)C2C(C(C(O2)C(OP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)O)F)O)O 	[[(S)-[(2S,3S,4R,5R)-5-(2,4-dioxopyrimidin-1-yl)-3,4-dihydroxy-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]-fluoro-methoxy]-hydroxy-phosphoryl] phosphono hydrogen phosphate
CN(C)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=CC(=NC(=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3OC)C4=CC=CC=C4OC 	4-[2,6-bis(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-pyridyl]-N,N-dimethyl-aniline
C1CN(CC2=CC=CC=C21)C(=O)CC3(CC(=O)N(C3=O)CCC4=CC=CC=N4)C5=CC=CC=C5 	(3R)-3-[2-(3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)-2-oxo-ethyl]-3-phenyl-1-[2-(2-pyridyl)ethyl]pyrrolidine-2,5-dione
CC(C(=O)N(C)C)NCC1=CC=C(C=C1)[Si](C)(C)C 	N,N-dimethyl-2-[(4-trimethylsilylphenyl)methylamino]propanamide
```
* To train from scratch on your custom data, run the following command in the cloned repository. Weight checkpoints will be saved after each training epoch in the ```checkpoints``` folder.
```
python3 src/molecular_transformer/train.py --data_path=data/YOUR_TRAINING_DATA.tsv
```
* To finetune the embeddings of a pretrained Transformer on your custom data, provide a path to a pretrained weight file to load before training.
```
python3 src/molecular_transformer/train.py --data_path=data/YOUR_TRAINING_DATA.tsv --checkpoint_path=checkpoints/pretrained.ckpt
```
* To train or finetune without GPU resources, provide the ``--cpu``` flag.
```
python3 src/molecular_transformer/train.py --data_path=data/YOUR_TRAINING_DATA.tsv --cpu --num_epochs=5.
```

A full list of arguments which control network hyperparameters is provided below, as well as in ```train.py```. The pretrained weights provided were trained using a batch size of 96, split across 4 GPUs, training for 2 epochs on a dataset of 83,000,000+ molecules. The 83m file can be downloaded by running the ```download_large.sh``` script.
